# IBuildIt - The GitHub of Automations

**Another $20/Month? No Thanks.**

Build it once. Own it forever.

## Overview

IBuildIt is a community-driven platform that provides standardized, ready-to-use automation workflows. Replace expensive SaaS subscriptions with workflows you own and control. Think of it as GitHub for automations - a centralized repository where builders share proven workflows with clear documentation, cost breakdowns, and step-by-step guides.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Standardized Documentation
Every workflow follows the same structure:
- **Input/Output clearly defined** - No guessing what triggers the workflow or where data goes
- **Prerequisites listed upfront** - API keys, accounts, and setup requirements
- **Cost transparency** - Exact monthly costs vs SaaS alternatives
- **Step-by-step guides** - With screenshots and video tutorials
- **Platform agnostic** - Works with n8n, Make.com, Zapier

### 2. Always Up to Date
- Community-maintained workflows
- Updated when APIs change
- Rated and reviewed by real users
- Not buried in Reddit threads or Twitter

### 3. Real Cost Savings
- Average savings: $150-300/month per workflow
- Pay only for API usage, not subscriptions
- Break-even typically within weeks
- Self-hosting options to save even more

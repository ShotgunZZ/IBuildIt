# IBuildIt - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 2.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-16
**Product Type:** Community-Driven Workflow Repository & Automation Library

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision
IBuildIt is a community-driven repository of ready-to-use automation workflows that replaces expensive SaaS subscriptions. We provide standardized, documented workflows for platforms like Zapier, Make.com, and n8n - enabling anyone to implement powerful automations without starting from scratch.

### 1.2 Core Value Proposition
**"The GitHub of Automations - Build Once, Share Forever"**

Instead of:
- Paying $200/month for multiple SaaS tools
- Rebuilding the same workflows others have already created
- Guessing how to structure complex automations

Users get:
- Pre-built, tested workflows with documentation
- Community-contributed variations and improvements
- Clear prerequisites, cost estimates, and customization guides
- Savings of $150-300/month vs traditional SaaS

### 1.3 Key Differentiators
1. **Standardized Format**: Every workflow follows the same structure (prerequisites ’ setup ’ build ’ customize)
2. **Platform Agnostic**: Supports Zapier, Make.com, n8n, and other automation platforms
3. **Input/Output Mapping**: Clear documentation of triggers and destinations
4. **Community-Driven**: Users contribute, rate, and improve workflows
5. **Cost Transparency**: Real API costs vs SaaS pricing for every workflow

## 9. Critical Questions & Decisions

### 9.1 Open Questions

**Q: Should we moderate all workflows before publishing?**
- **Option A:** Manual review (quality control, slower)
- **Option B:** Auto-publish with community flagging (faster, riskier)
- **Recommendation:** Start with manual review, move to auto-publish at 100+ workflows

**Q: How do we handle workflow maintenance?**
- APIs change, platforms update, workflows break
- **Recommendation:** Community-driven "This workflow needs update" flag + contributor notification

**Q: Should we allow monetization from day 1?**
- **Recommendation:** No. Keep it free initially to build library and trust. Introduce premium tier at 200+ workflows.

**Q: What if someone submits a malicious workflow?**
- **Recommendation:** Manual review + community reporting + workflow sandboxing documentation

---

### 9.2 Design Decisions Needed

**Visual Style:**
- [ ] Clean & minimal (like Linear) vs Vibrant & playful (like Notion)
- [ ] Screenshot-heavy vs Diagram-heavy workflow displays
- [ ] Video-first vs Text-first instructions

**User Experience:**
- [ ] Gated content (email required to view) vs Open access
- [ ] Workflow complexity scoring (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- [ ] Prerequisite setup videos: In-platform vs YouTube

**Community Structure:**
- [ ] Discord vs Forum vs Built-in comments
- [ ] Workflow ownership model (can others edit your workflow?)
- [ ] Attribution system (badges, profiles, leaderboards)

---

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1 Example Workflow: Meeting Transcription Bot

See **Section 3** for the full standardized format example.

---

### 10.2 Competitor Analysis

**Existing Alternatives:**

**Zapier Template Library**
- Pros: Large library, well-known brand
- Cons: Locked to Zapier, expensive, limited customization docs
- Differentiation: We're platform-agnostic + cost transparent

**Make.com Scenarios**
- Pros: Visual, easy to share
- Cons: Only Make.com, no standardized format
- Differentiation: We add prerequisites, I/O specs, cost estimates

**n8n.io Community Workflows**
- Pros: Open-source, developer-friendly
- Cons: Technical barrier, self-hosted only
- Differentiation: We support multiple platforms + beginner-friendly

**Reddit r/nocode, r/Zapier**
- Pros: Active community, free
- Cons: Unstructured, hard to search, no quality control
- Differentiation: Structured library with search, categories, ratings

---

### 10.3 Legal Considerations

**Content Ownership:**
- Contributors retain ownership
- Contributors grant IBuildIt license to display/distribute
- Clear attribution always required

**Liability:**
- Workflows provided "as-is"
- No guarantee of functionality
- Users responsible for their own API usage/costs

**Trademark:**
- "Replaces [SaaS Name]" is comparison, not endorsement
- Use clear disclaimer: "Not affiliated with [Company]"

**Privacy:**
- No PII collected unless user submits workflow
- API keys never requested or stored
- Analytics via privacy-friendly tools (Plausible/Fathom)

---

### 10.4 Resource Requirements

- 1 developer (you) - 40 hours for website
- 1 designer (optional) - 10 hours for branding/UI
